# Java Collections Hierarchy

Java Collections Framework has two distinct "families". One is branching from
the [Collection](collection.md) interface, other from the [Map](map.md) interface


## Map

Map based collection are not true collections(cause maps like name implies are key-value mappings
and collections are
just groups of values), but still present operations that allow them to be manipulated as collections

- [Map](map.md)
